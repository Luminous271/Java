- Long ago, there was a man named Bob. Bob died, and now he haunts storytellers. Legend has it that if you reference Bob exactly three times in a single story, Bob will come out of the campfire and yell “Boo!”. 
- Bob is a nice man. He helped me with my homework. There is no way Bob would scare me here. Bob is a nice man.
